Plot descriptions:

1. The histogram plot compares the number of suspicious reviews with unsuspicious reviews for apartments in Tampa. It shows that around 200 reviews are detected as suspicious while slightly over 3000 reviews have no suspicious nature, meaning nearly 7% of all reviews are suspicious. 

2. The scatter plot displays the relationship between the number of reviews and stars apartments have. We see that the worst (1 star) and the best (5 star) apartments have the fewest number of reviews while 3 star apartments have the most review counts in average. One can see that some apartments between 2 and 3.5 stars reach over 50 reviews.
